## 1] Why is client diversity important for Ethereum?

#### => Client diversity is important for Ethereum because it helps make Ethereum more secure and reliable. When different groups of people and organizations use different software clients to run the Ethereum network, it reduces the risk of a single point of failure. If everyone used the same client and there was a problem with that client, it could disrupt the entire network.
#### But with diverse clients, if one has a problem, the others can keep the network running smoothly. It's like having a backup plan in case something goes wrong. So, client diversity is like having many guards to protect the Ethereum network, making it stronger and more resistant to problems.

## 1] Where is the full Ethereum state held ?

#### => The full Ethereum state is held on the computers of people who run Ethereum nodes. These nodes are like participants in the Ethereum network who keep a copy of the entire Ethereum blockchain and the current state of all accounts and contracts on the network. This full state is distributed across many different computers around the world, and it's constantly updated as new transactions are added to the blockchain.

#### So, in simple terms, the full Ethereum state is stored on the computers of the people who are part of the Ethereum network by running nodes. It's not in one central location but spread out across many different machines.
